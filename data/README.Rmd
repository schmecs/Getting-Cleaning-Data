This is for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project due December 27, 2015.

My run_analysis.R set of scripts does the following:

* downloads the zipped archive from the UCI link

* creates the necessary folder to hold the data and unzips the files

* reads all the relevant tables into R using read.table()

* appends Activity labels and Variable names to the Test and Train data sets

* combines the Test and Train data sets into a single tidy data set

* creates an additional data set that is a set of mean calculations for each group of observations with a distinct combination of Subject, Activity, and Variable

* saves the tidy data set of means to a .txt file in the working directory
